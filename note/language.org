In lexicography, a lexical item (or lexical unit / LU, lexical entry)
is a single word, a part of a word, or a chain of words (catena) that
forms the basic elements of a language's lexicon (≈ vocabulary).

#+begin_quote
A morpheme is the smallest meaningful lexical item in a language. A
morpheme is not necessarily the same as a word. The main difference
between a morpheme and a word is that a morpheme sometimes does not
stand alone, but a word, by definition, always stands alone.

- quotes courtesy of slidercrank on ##russkij
  - device is a girl :) why? the Latin 'c' is pronounced 'ц'
    in Russian. So if you transliterate device, you'll get девице
    which sounds close to девица (girl)
    - how can it be a boy if you get 'abort/retry'? you girls
      can abort
  - someone who writes in C (пишет на С) is called насильник
    (С is pronounced СИ, so it's на СИ + льник. ник means the same
    as 'er' or 'ist' in English). насильник = raper
  - sometimes программировать is jokingly said/written as
    погроммировать (from the word 'pogrom'). basically "to cause a
    mess"
    - pogrom - An organized massacre of a particular ethnic group, in
      particular that of Jewish people in Russia or eastern Europe in
      the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
  - Погромисты is partially sounds like routers in Russian
  - someone who writes in ALGOL (Алго́л) is an alcoholic
    (алкого́лик)
