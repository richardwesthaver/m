** *UDP vs TCP*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b34a9d4a-7ff0-4566-8cd4-dce03cd0ee05
:END:
   - *UDP and TCP share the same space* in a network stack and operate
     on top of the IP protocol.
   - *UDP has no built-in notion of State*, TCP does. However,
     stateless protocols can be built on lower-level stateful
     ones.. and vice-versa. It's just a matter of abstraction.
	 - for example =HTTP= is a /stateless/ protocol, built
       on TCP (/stateful/), which is built on IP (/stateless/)
   - *TCP provides connection guarantees* that a client receives
     packets IN ORDER and exactly in the condition they were sent
     (thanks to checksums in headers), at the cost of some performance
     (to ensure packet sequencing, checking headers, establishing
     connection, etc)
     - *UDP does NOT provide connection guarantees*.
       - UDP does have checksums though, and thus
         ensures packets are received in same
         condition that they were sent.
     - Packets can be sent and lost, it doesn't intrinsically matter
       in UDP that the client didn't receive them.
     - The loss of built-in guarantees does come with a performance
       boost though, as well as a network protocol that is quite
       flexible in its simplicity.

*** *The need for speed*

	 UDP is on the rise in networks due to the usage of P2P
	 services, and the need for more /immediate/ methods of
	 streaming media data at scale.[fn:0]
