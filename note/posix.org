The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of
standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining
compatibility between operating systems.[1] POSIX defines both the
system- and user-level application programming interfaces (API), along
with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software
compatibility (portability) with variants of Unix and other operating
systems.
