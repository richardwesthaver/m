This Redditor with 12y of XP writing C++ talks about all the
complexities involved with coding in C++. OP is asking about some of
the nuances of [[file:rust.org][Rust]] vs. C++, and our Redditor avoids regurgitating the
common arguments that are given for Rust in favor of C++ - namely
Memory Safety and Data Races. A fitting quote from Nietszche is given
as explanation for not addressing those issues:

Whoever fights with monsters should see to it that he does not become
a monster in the process. And when you gaze long into an abyss the
abyss also gazes into you
