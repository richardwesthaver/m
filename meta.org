This is a system for /documenting/, /describing/, and /sharing/ my
personal projects.
* Intro
Instead of having a README file at the root of every public project as
is standard development practice, I write all =meta= content in a
single document. A program then parses this document and updates my
project META files with any changes found.

This approach has some advantages:
- Great for single contributor operations
- Bulk-updates for sets of projects
- (optional) auto-commits
- Easy to catch mistakes

And some disadvantages:
- Disaster for multiple contributor operations
- Non-standard
- Easy to make mistakes

The most important point to make is that the utility of this system
decreases exponentially with the number of /contributors/ you
have. It's designed to provide common formatting, terminology, media,
and references for all my project docs and ease the pain involved with
making arbitrary changes. It is a single 'source of truth', so there
should be only one soothsayer.

* Services
** [[https://rwest.io][rwest.io]]
The service that returns this page, and all other prose written by the
author. Most pages are generated from [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] files and compiled to
JS/WASM using [[https://yew.rs/][Yew]] and [[https://bulma.io/][Bulma]] CSS.

* Code
** Development
- All code is hosted at [[https://hg.rwest.io]] as Mercurial repos.
- Clonebundles are hosted at https://pkg.rwest.io/hg in all supported
  formats.
  - Clonebundles are generated daily and fetched by hg clients
    automatically via the =hg clone= command, which will bootstrap a
    local repo using an advertised bundle from https://pkg.rwest.io/hg
    and pick up any missing changesets directly from the upstream
    server repository.
- The default target platform is x86_64 GNU Linux for all programs and
  libraries, but static program binaries for all supported platforms are
  provided at [[https://pkg.rwest.io/bin/dist]]. Target-specific builds are
  documented on a per-project basis.
- Code is FOSS, copy-left licensed under WTFPL. feel free to use
  without condition.

Rlib is a mid-level library for systems programmingin Rust. It
provides common APIs and functionality used in my other projects. The
goal of this library is to provide a collection of modules for Rust
development on any platform. It includes primitive types and traits as
well as platform/domain-specific features.

* Writing
Notes, Rambles, Metas, and my portfolio are kept under version control
at https://hg.rwest.io/org.
* Music
I make music sometimes, because I enjoy the process. There are so many
things to appreciate in sound and it's easy to let yourself become
absorbed.

Most of the time I just jam with my synths and drum machines and hit
the record button. It's a good time.

- [[https://cdn.rwest.io/media/audio][audio loops]] \\
  I have a bunch of loops and other soundbytes I've created over the
  years - they're all in an Ableton project so that I can mix and
  arrange them for on-the-fly jam seshes.
