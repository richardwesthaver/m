#+TITLE: META
#+SETUPFILE: setup.org
* Overview
=meta= is basically a /doc generator/. The idea is to write
information about my personal projects in a single place for easy
distribution. For example, text or markdown can be generated for
repo READMEs, and html or pdf for web content.

This approach has some advantages:
- Great for single contributor operations
- Bulk-updates for sets of projects
- (optional) auto-commits
- Easy to catch mistakes

And some disadvantages:
- Can be a disaster for multiple contributor operations
- Non-standard
- Easy to make mistakes

This process is much easier than creating readmes and license files
individually for each project, and I find that it helps expose an
underlying /modus vivendi/ for my libraries and programs - the way in
which they interact and can coexist in a development environment.

* Usage

* Dev Notes
- All code is hosted on [[https://hg.rwest.io]] as Mercurial repos.
- Clonebundles are hosted at https://pkg.rwest.io/hg in all supported
  formats.
  - Clonebundles can be fetched by hg clients automatically via the
    =hg clone= command, which will bootstrap a local repo using an
    advertised bundle from https://pkg.rwest.io/hg and pick up any
    missing changesets directly from the upstream server repository.
- The /default/ target platform is x86 GNU Linux for all programs and
  libraries, but static program binaries are also provided at
  [[https://pkg.rwest.io/bin/dist]]. Target-specific builds are documented
  on a per-project basis.
- Code is FOSS, copy-left licensed under WTFPL. feel free to use
  without condition.

* Org
My notes and meta docs are kept under version control at
https://hg.rwest.io/org. They are written in Org-mode but exported to
a variety of formats.

Emacs is my IDE and text-editor of choice, so Org-mode is a natural
fit for all types of writing I do. The problem with Org is that it is
difficult to parse /outside of Emacs/. in =elisp=, the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][org-element api]]
fully supports the specification, but it is a monster task to
re-implement in another language. This is one of the few strong
arguments against Org-mode - but only when talking about the /full/
spec. It is quite feasible, with enough understanding of your own
workflow and Org-element internals, to design a subset for personal
use.

While I slowly work out a /small/ portable parser for a subset of the
spec, I have been using the built-in exporters with some scripts to
generate static content.

* Music
I make music sometimes, because I enjoy the process. There are so many
things to appreciate in sound and it's easy to let yourself become
absorbed.

Most of the time I just jam with my synths and drum machines and hit
the record button. It's a good time.

  I have a bunch of loops and other soundbytes I've created over the
  years - they're all in an Ableton project so that I can mix and
  arrange them for on-the-fly jam seshes.
