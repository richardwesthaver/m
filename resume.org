** Home Lab
I host a collection of services from a small cluster of laptops as opposed to the cloud. The public frontends for these services are optimized for my own use, thus they are quite simple, and perhaps a bit retro.

- [[https://hg.rwest.io][code]] - mercurial repositories
- [[https://pkg.rwest.io][packages]] - package distribution server

** Rust Libraries
I love the Rust programming language and have been building several libraries over the past few months. These libraries are the cornerstone for other programs I develop and use in my home lab environment.
- *[[https://hg.rwest.io/rlib][rlib]]* - a mid-level library providing a framework and shared API for systems programming
   - wrappers for low-level system modules such as cryptography, IO, and compression
   - logging facade, utilities, and ui components
   - concrete type system for 'objects' and 'configs' which can be serialized to json, ron, or bincode (binary)
- *[[https://hg.rwest.io/tenex][tenex]]* - a high-level library for RESTful API clients
   - provides access to web APIs such as Google, Discord, AWS
   - authentication and proxy support (coming soon)
* *Research*
For the past year I've spent time researching specific technologies that have the potential to drastically change the nature of computer interaction within the next 10 years. Below are some of the topics I'm invested in.
- HTTP/3, TLS1.3, QUIC, and the move from TCP to UDP in general
- SDR, software-defined radios
- IPFS, libp2p, and distributed services
- io_uring, the new async IO interface for Linux
- GPT-3, GPT-J, and the OpenAI beta API
- RISC-V, an open-source instruction set architecture for CPUs
- RocksDB, an embedded key-value storage engine built by Facebook
