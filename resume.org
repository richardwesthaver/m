For the past year I've spent time researching specific technologies
that have the potential to drastically change the nature of computer
interaction within the next 10 years. Below are some of the topics I'm
invested in.
- HTTP/3, TLS1.3, QUIC, and the move from TCP to UDP in general
- SDR, software-defined radios
- IPFS, libp2p, and distributed services
- io_uring, the new async IO interface for Linux
- GPT-3, GPT-J, and the OpenAI beta API
- RISC-V, an open-source instruction set architecture for CPUs
- RocksDB, an embedded key-value storage engine built by Facebook
