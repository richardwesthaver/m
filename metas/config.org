Unix system user configuration. Similar in spirit to =etc/skel=. This
doesn't do much right now, but will serve as a template for
bootstrapping new users with sensible defaults.

The files in this project can be used to bootstrap a Mercurial public
server configuration. The theme is a bit messy and will be remedied
some time in the future, likely following styles similiar to [[src:rwest_io][rwest_io]]
(currently BulmaCSS-based).

My poorman's distributed =nix= config has fallen into disrepair, but I
keep it around for old-time's sake. It might come in handy in the
future, depending on how the Nix ecosystem progresses.
