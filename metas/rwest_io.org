[[https://rwest.io][rwest.io]] is my online homepage. I use it to share my project
documentation called =metas= as well as my =notes=. It is designed
primarily for my own convenience, which comes with a few consequences
I'll talk about later.

The code for this site is open-source and includes HTML, SCSS, JS,
Rust, and Python.

This site does not track you, your personal information, or your
behavior in any way.
