I make music sometimes, because I enjoy the process. There are so many
things to appreciate in sound and it's easy to let yourself become
absorbed.

Most of the time I just jam with my synths and drum machines and hit
the record button. It's a good time.

  I have a bunch of loops and other soundbytes I've created over the
  years - they're all in an Ableton project so that I can mix and
  arrange them for on-the-fly jam seshes.
