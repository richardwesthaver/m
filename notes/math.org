- [[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] is a great place to find applied codegolf-type
  challenges and keep your chops up
   - if you're unfamiliar with the format, it will take time to
     learn. The homepage calls this process 'inductive chain learning'
     which just means that you build off your experience. By solving
     one, you learn something that helps you solve another.. then
     another.. and so on. It adds up.

In mathematics, the surreal number system is a totally ordered proper
class containing the real numbers as well as infinite and
infinitesimal numbers, respectively larger or smaller in absolute
value than any positive real number.

a form of geometry in which the metric for the distance between two
points is replaced by the sum of the /absolute differences/ of their
Cartesian coordinates, known as the taxicab metric, or Manhattan
Distance.
