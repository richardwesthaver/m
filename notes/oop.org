Object-oriented Programming (OOP for short) is a programming model
that organizes code around /objects/, and emphasizes the focus on
objects that we want to manipulate, rather than the functions and
logic necessary to manipulate them.

** Object
Objects can be definied as data fields that have /unique attributes
and behavior/. They are most often identified through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling][data modeling]],
which is the practice of organizing an Information system by applying
a variety of formal techniques.

** Principles of OOP

*** Encapsulation

*** Abstraction

*** Ineritance

*** Polymorphism
