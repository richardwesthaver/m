Disk storage (also sometimes called drive storage) is a general
category of storage mechanisms where data is recorded by various
electronic, magnetic, optical, or mechanical changes to a surface
layer of one or more rotating disks. A disk drive is a device
implementing such a storage mechanism. Notable types are the hard disk
drive (HDD) containing a non-removable disk, the floppy disk drive
(FDD) and its removable floppy disk, and various optical disc drives
(ODD) and associated optical disc media.
