#+title: straight.el
- https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el

=straight.el= is a modern replacement for [[file:package_el.org][package.el]] with a built-in
wrapper for [[file:use-package.org][use-package]] declarations, and a modular structure which
makes it easy to define custom package /recipes/.

- The way this package initializes is by being bootstrapped in the
  early stages of our Emacs startup with the following script:
  #+name: sraight-bootstrap
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (bootstrap-version 5))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
  #+end_src
