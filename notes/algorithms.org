- A very common algorithm used to find the index of a specific item in a
/sorted/ array.
- Array must be sorted
- Executes in logarithmic time
- Faster than linear search (except for very small arrays)
- Can be applied easily in many situations
- There are many variations of binary search such as fractional
  cascading and exponential search
- Many data structures provide a better overall design for fast
  optimal searches, such as Hash Tables

A divide and conquer algorithm for sorting an array. The array is
split into immutable chunks and then all chunks are merged in sorted
order.
- Invented by John von Neumann in 1945

Lubachevsky-Stillinger (compression) algorithm (LS algorithm, LSA, or
LS protocol) is a numerical procedure suggested by F. H. Stillinger
and B.D. Lubachevsky that simulates or imitates a physical process of
compressing an assembly of hard particles. As the LSA may need
thousands of arithmetic operations even for a few particles, it is
usually carried out on a computer.

A very simple, symmetrical substition cipher that shifts a character
by 13 positions. Since the standard alphabet has 26 characters, this
operation is its own inverse.
- The canonical example of weak encryption.
