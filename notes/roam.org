Roam is a "note-taking tool for networked thought". According to the website:

#+begin_quote
As easy to use as a document. As powerful as a graph database.
Roam helps you organize your research for the long haul.

This is a very interesting concept which closely resembles the
personal-wiki/mind-dump applications that currently exist, perhaps
with a focus on research.

This is a paid web-based service, so not something we're interested
in, but overall a good continuation of the mind-mapping framework.
