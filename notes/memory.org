** Allocation
*** Arenas
#+begin_quote
Arena allocation is a memory management technique where a set of
objects have the same lifetime and can be deallocated at the same
time. An arena is an object responsible for allocating and
deallocating the memory. Since large chunks of memory are allocated
and deallocated at once (rather than allocating individual objects),
arena allocation is very efficient. Usually, all the objects are
allocated from a contiguous chunk of memory, that improves cache
coherency when you are traversing the graph.
