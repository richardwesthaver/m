* Computer Programming
#+begin_quote
Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result
or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as:
analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and
resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen
programming language (commonly referred to as coding).

#+begin_quote
Agent-based models (ABM) are computer programs that define agents,
virtual entities that imitate the decision-making processes and
interactions of real people, animals, neurons, computers, or other
individuals. ABMs have a wide range of applications. For example, an
ABM can study a flock of birds. The behavior of each virtual bird can
be as simple as just trying to fly in close proximity to the nearest
neighbor; the software can show that this birds combine their behavior
to generate the complex, adaptive patterns of flight of real
flocks. An ABM can also study economic behavior: in a virtual society,
sellers of goods set a price based on limited information they have
about the market, and buyers may bargain based on their own limited
information about the market. Even with simple rules, an economic ABM
can generate complex patterns that can be useful to understand real
macroeconomic trends.
