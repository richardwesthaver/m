#+title: Version Control
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control
Version Control (or revision control, source control, source code
management..) most commonly refers to the practice of /managing
changes/ to computer programs, documents, or other collections of
information.

The 'Version' in Version Control refers to a specific state of the
/repository/, often represented as a [[file:hash.org][hash]] key. This key is used to
identify these 'Versions' in a given Version Control System.

  - Two different plugins - [[https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/GitExtension][git]] and [[https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/HgGit][hggit]], different features
  - 'git' usage will treat a cloned repo as a git repo and just pull
    branch heads into mercurial (.git directory and .hg directory present at root)
  - 'hggit' will convert all changesets, branches, etc (.hg directory only)
     - pulling changesets can be incredibly slow at times
     - unlike vanilla hg, pulling from a git repo with hggit does NOT
       support revision CLI flag ('-r 100' will not work), so the
       standard method of doing an incremental pull is not possible
     - expect unexpected behaviors. always have backups.
  - hggit will often pull the 'github-pages' branch from repos using
    GitHub Sites and treat it as the default branch in the resulting
    clone. To make the repo usable you need to update to the 'master'
    bookmark, and use that as default
