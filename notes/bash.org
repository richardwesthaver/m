Bash is the GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell. This is an
sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn
shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the
IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers
functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive
use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without
modification.
