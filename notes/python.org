Python is one of the most popular programming languages out there
coming in at [[https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php][#2 in popularity and growing as of 2021]]. It is a
dynamically-typed, garbage-collected language with simple, very
readable syntax. It is well-maintained with a vast community of
developers.

It is an [[file:oop.org][OOP]]-based interpretted programming language based on C.

- One of the draws of Python is the ease in which you can just 'get
something done' quickly. CTFers and other types of competitive hackers
prefer it for precisely this reason. 

- Another advantage is the ease in which Python can be understood by
  humans, making it a great beginner language for anyone. This also
  makes it a great choice for Research and Academic fields where
  non-programmers are involved, as source code snippets can be
  included in your work with minimal explanation.
