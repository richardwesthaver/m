Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on
retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to
improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when
experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual.
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
-- /George Santayana, 1905/
