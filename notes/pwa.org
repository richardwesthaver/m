** PWAs Today - 
*** [[https://blog.bitsrc.io/what-is-a-pwa-and-why-should-you-care-388afb6c0bad][What is a PWA and Why Should You Care?]]
   - gives the basic highlights
    - read "Why we need PWAs and what are their features?" section for tl;dr
   - DemoTime: [[https://www.fidgetspin.xyz/][Fidget Spinner]] --> F12 goto 'Applications' tab
*** [[https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/][PWAs - Google Dev]]
   - need manifest.json, service worker with offline capabilities
   - to trigger install-prompt in chrome - need to have some kind of initial engagment with the app
*** Connecting the dots - [[https://uxdesign.cc/pwas-are-the-future-d51aae1f3af7][UX Perspective]]

** PWAs Tomorrow
  - some of this might get rather technical
*** [[https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html][PWAs have dependencies]]
   - this is an old post so nothing to worry about in the short term, but the PWA ecosystem is highly dependent on gatekeepers
     * Google, Apple, Microsoft
   - gatekeepers make the rules and set prescribed tech through the manifest.json approval process
   - potential for support for systems tech to be dropped - large tech debt to overcome
*** [[https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker][Service Workers]] - quick note on this article
   #+begin_quote
   Because the service worker is not blocking (it's designed to be fully asynchronous) synchronous XHR and localStorage cannot be used in a service worker.
