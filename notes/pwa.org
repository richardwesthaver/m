* PWAs Today - 
** [[https://blog.bitsrc.io/what-is-a-pwa-and-why-should-you-care-388afb6c0bad][What is a PWA and Why Should You Care?]]
   - gives the basic highlights
    - read "Why we need PWAs and what are their features?" section for tl;dr
   - DemoTime: [[https://www.fidgetspin.xyz/][Fidget Spinner]] --> F12 goto 'Applications' tab
** [[https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/][PWAs - Google Dev]]
   - need manifest.json, service worker with offline capabilities
   - to trigger install-prompt in chrome - need to have some kind of initial engagment with the app
** Connecting the dots - [[https://uxdesign.cc/pwas-are-the-future-d51aae1f3af7][UX Perspective]]

* PWAs Tomorrow
  - some of this might get rather technical
** [[https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html][PWAs have dependencies]]
   - this is an old post so nothing to worry about in the short term, but the PWA ecosystem is highly dependent on gatekeepers
     * Google, Apple, Microsoft
   - gatekeepers make the rules and set prescribed tech through the manifest.json approval process
   - potential for support for systems tech to be dropped - large tech debt to overcome
** [[https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker][Service Workers]] - quick note on this article
   #+begin_quote
   Because the service worker is not blocking (it's designed to be fully asynchronous) synchronous XHR and localStorage cannot be used in a service worker.

*** two schools of thought on asynchronous vs synchronous
**** make everything asynchronous - (how our react/GQL frontend operates today)
***** independent workers for each job 
***** slower than synchronous, but generally much improved UX
**** only use asynchronous when necessary - (not possible with PWAs)
***** seems like a small thing, but has significant impact on product vision
***** members of this club tend to optimize for [[https://news.ycombinator.com/news][this]] experience, compared to [[https://www.elektronauts.com/news][this]] one (consider site load time) 
***** PWAs are a standard now, but one could say that it's a result of echo-chamber type practices at Google HQ and extreme over-engineering
**** just something to keep in mind - at a high level - 
***** do we want to be a fully-featured, generalized LMS? or a slimmed down, specialized LMS?
***** How do we position ourselves in this industry over the next 5 years?
****** Are our competitors going to try to specialize? or generalize? 
****** How will our competitors react to the product decision that we choose ourselves?

* General Arch Thoughts
