 Transport-layer network protocol, part of the Chromium project.
 - Leverages the benefits of building on top of UDP instead of TCP
 - Designed as a re-implementation of TCP+TLS+HTTP/2
 - Great documentation (ty Mr. Google) + has Rust implementations
   (yay!) which leads us to:
 - [[https://crates.io/crates/quinn][Quinn]]
   - Rust implementation of the QUIC protocol.
   - Super awesome-cool
   - provides an API built with tokio
   - provides the core /deterministic state machine/ of the protocol
     via [[https://github.com/djc/quinn/tree/master/quinn-proto][=quinn-proto=]]
 - [[https://www.chromium.org/quic/playing-with-quic][Playing With QUIC]] provides documentation on how to set up a test
   client/server from the chromium source, a bit verbose for our needs
   but relevant
