- <> = tag, encapsulates 'elements'
- Everything you need to learn the basic HTML spec is included in
  modern web browsers. To get started, right click anywhere on a
  webpage and 'Inspect Element'.
- The Living Spec is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5][HTML5]]. It includes a bunch of modern-era elements
  like =<canvas>= =<video>= =<audio>= =<main>=.
- The term =HTML= is somewhat of a cluster nowadays - it can refer to
  anything X/HTML/5 or /HTML-like/. When building systems that
  leverage =HTML=, it is important to understand to the differences
  between implementations of HTML parsers across different programs
  and libraries. Read the docs.
