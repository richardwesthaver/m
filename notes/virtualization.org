Virtualization (or more specifically, hardware virtualization) is a
method of sharing hardware components across individual /virtual
machines/ (VMs).

In software development, the host computer shares its resources with
individual VMs by using a /hypervisor/ or /virtual machine manager/
(VMM).

Virtualization technology is constanty evolving, and we likely have a
long way to go before we get it right, but the increase in popularity
that is likely due to the use of virtualization in microservice/web
based apps has made it more approachable in the tech community, and
accepted as a core components of DevOps.
