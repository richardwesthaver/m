Lubachevsky-Stillinger (compression) algorithm (LS algorithm, LSA, or
LS protocol) is a numerical procedure suggested by F. H. Stillinger
and B.D. Lubachevsky that simulates or imitates a physical process of
compressing an assembly of hard particles. As the LSA may need
thousands of arithmetic operations even for a few particles, it is
usually carried out on a computer.
