This project contains documents I've written in plain-text which are
used to generate my [[https://rwest.io][website]] and readmes.
- =m.org= contains formal docs for projects
- =n.org= contains informal notes
- =cv.org= is my resume (hire me!)

** Syntax Extensions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       93185ce3-7b16-4f9b-8e59-39127869ac45
:END:
The source files assume some familiarity with org syntax. Org syntax
is covered [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][online]] in detail and high-level info about document
structure can be found in the [[info:emacs#Top][Emacs manual]].

All docs are fully compliant with org, with the addition of some
special elements that may appear in the body (or =section=) of any
heading.
- props ::
  All nodes have an optional number of "props" which are denoted as a
  list item that uses =+= followed by the prop symbol and an
  `edge` (=--=, =<-=, =->=). These can appear anywhere in the =section= element of a node
  (not just immediately following properties drawer). They're like a
  shorthand for custom properties.
- drawers ::
  Org-mode has a feature called drawers, which are collapsible
  sections of text starting with =:DRAWER_NAME:= and ending with
  =:END:=. The most common one seen in our docs is the PROPERTIES
  drawer, but there are a few special ones we use, especially in
  =n.org=: =notes=, =opinion=, and =dialog=.
** Exporting
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e350dd4f-eab2-477b-9ce7-c39e4e4d75e0
:END:
- Emacs has many backends for [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][exporting]] powered by [[https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/ox-docstrings.html][ox.el]] - an
  emacs-lisp script is all that is needed to generate conventional
  formats like HTML.
- A list of publishing templates are defined to export individual
  modules or output formats.
- Each format is generated in a separate temporary directory
- While the elisp script is chugging along, some pre-processing occurs
  which parses the org files and creates an intermediate
  representation for ingestion by internal services.
- Compression and archiving is also performed to generate =.tz=
  (tar.zst) packages for each format.
- New content can now be viewed online at [[https://rwest.io][rwest.io]] and downloaded at
  [[https://rwest.io/x][rwest.io/x]] which includes .tz packages.

- configure desktop displays with xrandr (Linux only + =x11=)

Conditional compilation flags are used - so this program will only
print IP, weather, and USB devices on Windows.

This crate is not (yet) published on crates.io. To get started you'll need
to clone the [[src:rlib][repo]] and add it as a dependency to your project like so:
#+begin_src toml
[package]
name = "foo"
#...
[dependencies]
rlib = { version = "0.1.0", path = "../rlib", features = ["cli","kala","anyhow"]} #include some features
#+end_src

then just use the modules in your code:
#+begin_src rust
use rlib::{ctx, logger, kala};
use rlib::util::Result;
#[ctx::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
  logger::flexi("debug")?;
  println!("greetings stranger!");
  kala::cmd::sys::describe_host();
  Ok(())
}
#+end_src

Once our local cargo package registry is complete, instructions will
be included for how to use this crate from within a =shed= development
environment.

library.

- obj
  - [[https://docs.rwest.io/rlib/doc/obj][API docs]]
  =Objects= are pre-defined Rust structs that can easily encode to RON,
  JSON or Bincode, and tagged with metadata such as an =Id=, for easy
  indexing. They implement a few traits, namely =Objective= and
  =Identity= which define common functions.

  Objects can be initialized using the =Objective= methods, which allows
  all fields in their type definition to be decoded from JSON, RON, or
  bincode. Some Objects also provide methods used to parse the
  underlying type itself, such as =Wav= for .wav audio files and =Org=
  for .org text files.

Re-using code is an important part of software development. We re-use
code when importing a library module, using macros, writing classes,
and [[https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/19/how-often-do-people-actually-copy-and-paste-from-stack-overflow-now-we-know/][copying code from Stack Overflow]]. As such, programmers have often
come up with systems for collecting code that they can re-use in other
contexts.

=babel= is one of these systems. It is highly integrated with [[id:205131fc-ff48-4e0b-a3e8-ab52d5b6ca19][shed]] and
[[id:903f8087-e0af-48f2-a5a6-f8d7f080464a][GNU Emacs]] which are used to modify, organize, and implement our
collections.

Collections are described by three categories:
- sn :: common domain-specific code snippets
- sc :: generalized scripts in a variety of languages
- tm :: project templates

Each category provides its own methods of interaction available to the
user for different types of meta-programming activities. There are
also high-level interfaces for composing ephemerial hacking sessions
and configuration.

This project is an extension of the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Library-of-Babel.html][Library of Babel]] - which allows
you to define blocks of code in an org file, and call them
remotely. =babel= is in fact just this - a collection of code blocks
in an org file. Emacs was previously distributed with an initial
collection; [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/worg/tree/master/item/library-of-babel.org][library-of-babel.org]]. This is no longer the case, but the
powerful functionality of =org-babel= is still there, in all its
glory.

The goal of =babel= however is not just to build collections, but to
provide APIs for them. As such a large focus of this project will be
on exporting and parsing collections built in Emacs so that they can
be used by other processes. Our intention is to mimick the powerful
meta-programming capabilities of =org-babel= (specifically, the
ability to mix and match functions /from any language/) in a
user-defined runtime.

some time in the future, likely following styles similiar to [[src:rwest_io][rwest_io]]
(currently BulmaCSS-based).

I've been using Emacs since 2016 as my primary editor. I started with
Spacemacs, used Doom for a while, then started rolling my own
configurations. Configuring the Emacs editor requires learning the
Emacs language - emacs-lisp. It is a dialect of Common Lisp which can
be a bit tricky to adapt to for non-Lisp programmers, but it is built
specifically for Emacs.

This meta covers my Emacs modules, configurations, scripts, and other
code written in emacs-lisp. I have a main configuration which is
thousands of lines, but lately I've been experimenting with running
multiple smaller isolated emacs servers, with their own unique
configs.

The (old) main configuration file. A lot of this is getting moved to
our =notes=. The resulting files will be refactored. Despite being
messy, it's still very effective (see [[id:005d2a6e-d34f-45ee-a169-f26fc264c916][Screenshots]]).

Poorman's distributed =nix= config has fallen into disrepair, but I
keep it around for old-time's sake. It might come in handy in the
future, depending on how the Nix ecosystem progresses.

This is a private crate registry for the Rust programming
language.

The [[https://crates.io][crates.io]] package registry provides a number of excellent crates,
integrates well with the =cargo= development tool, and should be
preferred in all cases. I use =crater= when I need to:
- import my unpublished crates
- import the master branch of a published crate
- import a local or patched version of a published crate
- import a non-git crate (hg)

=crater= also works well in intranet/local environments, and can be
deployed for use in the following ways:
- remote :: same as crates.io, registry index is publicly hosted on GitHub (default)
- local :: registry index is stored locally, crates are retrieved remotely
- static :: registry index and crate sources are stored locally, no
  network requests are required

I make music sometimes, because I enjoy the process. There are so many
things to appreciate in sound and it's easy to let yourself become
absorbed.

Most of the time I just jam with my synths and drum machines and hit
the record button. It's a good time.

  arrange them for on-the-fly jam seshes.
