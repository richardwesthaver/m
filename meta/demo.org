Project demos and examples relating to =rlib= and =tenex=.

** Examples
*** hgsub-sort.rs
Sorts a Mercurial Subrepos file (=.hgsub=) alphabetically.
*** hi.rs
A startup script I run after logging in to my desktop. It does a few things:
- print my public IP
- print a weather report
- print list of connected USB devices
- build a tmux session and attach to it (Unix only + =tmux=)
- configure desktop displays with xrandr (Linux only + =x11=)
- spawn some desktop widgets (Linux only + =conky=)
- set my desktop background (Linux only + =fehbg=)

Conditional compilation flags are used - so this program will only
print IP, weather, and USB devices on Windows.
